# Google Calendar to Sheets Script 
Takes events from your Google calendar and matches them with event on a Google sheet and adds 1 more to the amount of events.

This script is perfect for automising your workflow if you need to record events and count them in order to keep track of the amount you    do in a week/month etc. 

There is a doc with the idea behind it and how the code works included.

I use Windows Task schedular to run it at the end of day so avoiding running it manually.
